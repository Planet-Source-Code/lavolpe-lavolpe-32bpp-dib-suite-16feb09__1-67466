### Description

Updatd to fix 2 logic errors. Enclosed is a suite of classes that allow you to work strictly with 32bpp DIBs, including recognizing transparency/alpha channels in gifs, icons, pngs, tga &amp; bitmaps. There are a bunch of "nice to have" routines and maybe an eye-opener or two for some of you. The classes are heavily commented. 18Feb08. Added text support &amp; tiling. 9Mar08: Added TGA read/write, save as JPG, added Paul Caton's revised CDECL thunks for safer zlib usage, updated sample form. Review Change History in the RTF file for important notes &amp; overview of class functions/properties. Most recent changes: Manually parsing grayscale PNGs can fail to correctly parse transparency, and the icon parser could fail to recognize some transparency in the icon mask.
